A very short guide to using non-graphical versions of GARLI:

1. Move or copy the GARLI executable (in the bin directory
 for precompiled versions) into the same directory as a
 GARLI configuration file named garli.conf and a dataset to 
 be analyzed (in Nexus, Pylip or Fasta format).

2. Edit the garli.conf file in a text editor and enter the
 name of the dataset to be analyzed on the datafname line.
 The other lines in the configuration file can be ignored 
 for now.

3. On Windows you can then double-click the executable.  On
 other OS's you will need to start the program from the command
 line.  In a terminal window, get to the directory with the
 files in it.  Start the program with 
 ./GarliXXX
 where the XXX will depend on the exact version of the program.

4. Look through the output files that have been created.  They
 contain a variety of information about the search itself as well
 as the details of the inferred tree and model of substition.

You can find sample configuration files in the example directory,
including one already named garli.conf that is all set up to analyze
the included 64 taxon rana.nex dataset (this should take between
10 and 30 minutes, depending on the speed of your computer).

You can specify configuration files to use that are not named
garli.conf by passing them on the command line:
./GarliXXX myconfigurationfilename

To avoid having to copy the executable into each run directory
you can either put it somewhere in your path (OS X or linux),
make a shortcut in the directory (Windows) or make a symbolic
to the executable in the directory (OS X or linux)
